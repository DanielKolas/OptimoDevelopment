Renovation plan:
1. Paint walls
- select the color pallet
- buy painting equipment; do not forget about the plastic foil
- call uncle John and ask him for help with painting
- schedule a meeting for Saturday or Sunday
2. Arrange new furniture
- measure the distance between the heater and the power supply as well as between the sofa and the window
- select the desk, chair, and free-standing cabinet; make sure that colors match the ones prepared for painting and that the furniture will fit in the given dimensions
- before placing the furniture, attach small pieces of felt underneath it, so that it will not scratch the floor
3. Prepare working space
- buy plants, notebooks, binders, and a new, big mug
- store all the required equipment in the free-standing cabinet; ensure that all the binders are labeled in the format NAME_MM/YYYY
- place on the desk all the devices necessary for a work
- make sure that the lighting is suitable for an 8-hour shift, if not, add an additional lamp next to the plants
